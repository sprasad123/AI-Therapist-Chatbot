# AI Therapist Chatbot
The AI Therapist chatbot was made to support students ages 12 years older. The transformer model (Blenderbot) was fine-tuned on 3000 dataset rows with equally balanced mental health topics that students face. The transformer model, called Blenderbot, is from Meta and can be found on HuggingFace. It's a text-to-text transformer with 400M parameters, performs well in open-domain conversations, and can display empathy. The max tokens (e.g. context window) are 128 tokens. The output is a text-based response. The chatbot user interface is based on Streamlit, where people can share how they're feeling and receive support from the chatbot.

# Evaluation
The AI therapist's output message was labeled with the counseling skills used (via ChatGPT) and the emotions expressed (via Hume.ai). For evaluation, I compared the counseling skills used by the AI therapist chatbot against the dataset therapist. I also compared the emotions expressed by the AI therapist chatbot and the dataset therapist. I generated the emotion expression via Hume.ai. I calculated the Cosine Similarity to find how similar the AI Therapist was from the dataset therapist. The threshold of 50% or higher similarity was how much overlap I wanted to see between the AI Therapist and the therapist from the dataset. 62.5% of the conversations had a Cosine Similarity of 50% or higher for the counseling skills. 67.5% of the conversations had a Cosine Similarity of 50% of higher the emotions expressed.
